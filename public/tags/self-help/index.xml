      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was watching &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/john_wooden_on_the_difference_between_winning_and_success.html&#34;&gt;John Wooden&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/&#34;&gt;Ted Talks&lt;/a&gt; when he made the following quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At God&#39;s footstool, to confess,
A poor soul knelt and bowed his head.
&#34;I failed,&#34; he cried. The master said,
&#34;Thou didst thy best. That is success.&#34;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have to say, I was rather moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&#34;Thou didst thy best. That is success.&#34;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All too often, we look around and compare ourselves against what we see. We rate our achievements against those of other people, when the true test of accomplishment is against &lt;strong&gt;our&lt;/strong&gt; personal best, not someone elseâ€™s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have not done my best. Worse - I have not even &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to do my best. I have coasted along, doing just enough to get by. Just enough to pay the bills. Just enough to get through school. I feel I have wasted those years. I have whittled away at time, till all that was left is the shavings of my life scattered on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It changes. Now. Today. Right this second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how poor at something I turn out to be, I want to be able to look at my progress and say &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I did my best. That is success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; That is the promise to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you on the far side of better.&lt;/p&gt;
