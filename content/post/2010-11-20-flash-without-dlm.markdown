![Flash without DLM](/static/2010/11/flashdlm.png)

Want to download and install flash without the download manager? I know I do.

Why force installation of a download manager for files that are only a few megabytes? It’s an overhead that simply isn’t required. I don’t need any more rubbish installed on my computer and neither do you.

The links below will take you to the official install files. Download to your local machine and install directly.

**Flash installer for Firefox, Safari and Opera**
