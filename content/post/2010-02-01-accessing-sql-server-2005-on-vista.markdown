Windows Admins are not automatically SQL Server 2005 Admins. There's a provisioning tool that runs at the end of the service pack setup that fixes this. If you skip past it or SQL Server isn't running then you need to run the tool separately.

You can do this by running the "SQL Server Surface Area Configuration" tool and clicking "Add New Administrator".
