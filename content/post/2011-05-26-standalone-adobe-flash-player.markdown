It took me a while to find this. Only because I didn't read the actual page! There's 3 highly visible links leading you away from the standalone player which is below. Adobe call their standalone player a "projector".

Update: It would help if I posted a link wouldn't it :)

If you can't find it either, take a look at the picture below.
