In The Trenches - Takeaways

Entries on "Card":
 Liked the idea of "Importance" over "Priority". (ie Importance of 10 is low, 150 is high. Values are not relative - 100 is not 5 times more important than 20).
 
 Sprint Demo - Do this, Do that, then this should happen. (page 10)
 
 Other Story Fields that would be useful
  Track - i.e. Back Office, Optimization etc. Allows product owner to concentrate on specific areas of functionality.
  Components - checkboxes in Excel. i.e. DB, Client, Server etc. Allows work to be split amongst multiple teams.
  
 Technical stories should be rewritten. The technical bit can be added as a note but main text should be from user POV & not technical.
  i.e. "Add indexes" becomes "Speed up search. Note: Indexes may be solution."
  Issue is we're not sure adding indexes is solution until analysis has occured.
  
Sprint Planning
 Most important event in Scrum.
